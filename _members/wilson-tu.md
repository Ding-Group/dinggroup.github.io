I am currently a Master's student in the Computer Science Department at the University of British Columbia. 
My research interest lies in developing novel machine-learning methods, especially around deep neural networks that enhance our understanding of Cancer biology. My current project involves analyzing prostate cancer patient samples using various sequencing technologies in collaboration with my co-supervisor Dr. Alexander Wyatt.
